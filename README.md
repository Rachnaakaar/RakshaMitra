# Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System

## Overview

This project is developed for the Smart India Hackathon and addresses the challenge of ensuring tourist safety using advanced technologies like AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing. The solution is designed for regions where tourism is vital, and traditional safety measures are insufficient, such as the Northeast of India.

## Problem Statement

Tourist safety is a growing concern, especially in remote and high-risk areas. Manual tracking and conventional policing methods are inadequate. This project proposes a smart, technology-driven system for real-time monitoring, rapid incident response, and secure identity verification, while maintaining privacy and ease of travel.

## Key Features

### 1. Digital Tourist ID Generation Platform
- Secure blockchain-based issuance of digital IDs at entry points (airports, hotels, check-posts).
- IDs include KYC (Aadhaar/passport), trip itinerary, and emergency contacts.
- IDs are valid only for the duration of the visit.

### 2. Mobile Application for Tourists
- Auto-assigned Tourist Safety Score based on travel patterns and area sensitivity.
- Geo-fencing alerts for high-risk or restricted zones.
- Panic Button for live location sharing with police and emergency contacts.
- Optional real-time tracking for families and law enforcement.

### 3. AI-Based Anomaly Detection
- Detects sudden location drop-offs, prolonged inactivity, or route deviations.
- Flags missing, silent, or distress behaviour for investigation.

### 4. Tourism Department & Police Dashboard
- Real-time visualization of tourist clusters and high-risk zones.
- Access to digital ID records, alert history, and last known locations.
- Automated E-FIR generation for missing person cases.

### 5. IoT Integration
- Smart bands/tags for tourists in high-risk areas (caves, forests).
- Continuous health/location signals and manual SOS feature.

### 6. Multilingual Support
- App and platform available in 10+ Indian languages and English.
- Voice/text emergency access for elderly or disabled travellers.

### 7. Data Privacy & Security
- End-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws.
- Blockchain ensures tamper-proof identity and travel records.

## Solution Architecture

- **Web Portal & Mobile App:** For tourists and authorities to access services and information.
- **AI/ML Models:** For behaviour tracking, anomaly detection, and predictive alerts.
- **Blockchain:** For secure ID generation and verification.
- **Dashboards:** Real-time monitoring for police and tourism departments.
- **IoT Wearables (Optional):** Enhanced safety in high-risk areas.
- **Automated Alert & Evidence Logging:** For rapid response and investigation.

## Impact

- Enhanced safety and rapid response for tourists.
- Improved efficiency for law enforcement and tourism departments.
- Secure, privacy-preserving identity and travel records.
- Multilingual and accessible platform for all travellers.
